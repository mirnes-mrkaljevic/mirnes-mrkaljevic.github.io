“This is the last time I am doing overtime hours. It won’t happen again for sure.” You are thinking about this and in the meantime your team lead comes into the office and interrupts your thoughts with the similar story: ”Hey guys, only this time we need to do extra effort and after that we will be more concerned about deadlines.” Few months later, a new project and the same story. Sounds familiar? 

## Reasons

This can be due to vary of reasons. Some of them could be:

- Poor planning is reflected by inadequate scoping and requirements. Without a clear understanding what needs to be done, it's impossible to give a good estimate.
- False optimism by decision makers. Tendency to not think about the details, thinking everything would go smoothly. But if something could go wrong, it will (always) ☺
- Pressure from clients who are pushing for fast results to meet market demands.
- Underestimating external dependencies. Not giving enough attention to the third party interface integration.
- Hero Culture. Teams may embrace a toxic "work harder, not smarter" mentality, leading to overpromising and underdelivering.

## What to do in order to fix it?

Allthough there is no silver bullet that can fix everything at once, some of the approaches that could help are:

- Make communication more transparent. Encourage open discussions and stick to realistic goals.
- Automate repetitive tasks. Automate testing and CI/CD pipelines.
- Adopt agile practices. Divide scope, try to give realistic estimates on smaller pieces. Make use of retrospectives and reviews of previous projects.
- Divide project to more deliverable portions. Clients would be happy to see that something is happening, and also would be able to give some initial feedback. On the other side, you will have clearer picture on what needs to be done and how fast it can be delivered.
- Hold leaders accountable. Good leaders push back against unreasonable deadlines, first to maintain good team morale, and second to build trustworthiness with clients.

## Conclusion

Unreasonable deadlines might seem unavoidable, but their long-term costs outweigh short-term gains. Foster realistic expectations, plan effectively, and communicate openly to build a sustainable, productive engineering culture.
