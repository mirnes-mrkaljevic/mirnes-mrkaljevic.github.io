The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime, providing flexibility in designing software. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you have multiple ways of performing a task, and you want to choose the implementation dynamically without altering the client code.

## When To Use It?

- **You Have Multiple Algorithms or Behaviors.** Use it when you have a need for muplitple ways of performing a task, and you want to make these implementations interchangeable. Examples: Different sorting algorithms, payment methods, discount calculations...
- **You Want to Eliminate Conditional Logic.** If you find yourself writing large if-else or switch statements to decide which algorithm to use, this pattern can simplify and clean up your code. Examples: A game character with different attack styles 
- **You Need Runtime Flexibility.** Use this pattern if the choice of algorithm or behavior needs to be decided dynamically at runtime rather than compile-time. Example: A game character that changes its movement strategy based on terrain type.
  

## When Not To Use It?

- **The Behavior is Unlikely to Change.** If the behavior or algorithm is stable and unlikely to require changes, introducing the this pattern may add unnecessary complexity. Example: A basic calculator where operations (add, subtract) are fixed.
- **You Don't Need Runtime Flexibility.** If the algorithm is chosen at compile-time or hardcoded, the strategy pattern is overkill.
- **Strategies Require Too Much Shared State.** If the strategies rely heavily on the internal state of the context class, they can become tightly coupled, defeating the purpose of the pattern.

  

## Key Components

- **Strategy Interface:** Defines a common interface for all the algorithms (strategies).
- **Concrete Strategies:** Implement different versions of the algorithm defined in the strategy interface.
- **Context:** Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the work to the strategy.

  

## Example in C&#35;

**Interface**

```csharp
public interface IMoveStrategy
{
    void Move();
}

```

**Concrete Strategies**

```csharp
public class Crouch : IMoveStrategy
{
    public void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Character is crouching slowly...");
    }
}

public class Walk : IMoveStrategy
{
    public void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Character is walking at a normal pace...");
    }
}

public class Run : IMoveStrategy
{
    public void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Character is running fast...");
    }
}

```

**Context**

```csharp
public class CharacterContext
{
    private IMoveStrategy _moveStrategy;

    public CharacterContext(IMoveStrategy moveStrategy)
    {
        _moveStrategy = moveStrategy;
    }

    public void SetMovementStrategy(IMoveStrategy moveStrategy)
    {
        _moveStrategy = moveStrategy;
    }

    public void ExecuteMove()
    {
        _moveStrategy.Move();
    }
}

```

**Client**

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a character with an initial movement strategy (Walk)
        CharacterContext character = new CharacterContext(new Walk());

        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nChoose movement: crouch, walk, run, or exit.");
            string input = Console.ReadLine()?.ToLower();

            if (input == "exit")
                break;

            // Manually select the strategy based on user input
            IMoveStrategy selectedStrategy = input switch
            {
                "crouch" => new Crouch(),
                "walk" => new Walk(),
                "run" => new Run(),
                _ => null
            };

            if (selectedStrategy != null)
            {
                character.SetMovementStrategy(selectedStrategy);
                character.ExecuteMove();
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Invalid input! Please enter crouch, walk, or run.");
            }
        }
    }
}

```

  

## Conclusion

The Strategy Pattern provides flexibility, scalability, and cleaner code, making it a great choice for scenarios like game character movement, AI behavior, and dynamic algorithm selection.
