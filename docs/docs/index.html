In this post, we’ll walk through a simple example of how to use Moq  as mocking framework and Dependency Injection with NUnit in the context of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in C#. This combination allows for clean, maintainable tests by mocking dependencies and focusing on the behavior of the system under test. <a title="Read more..." href="/tdd-and-mocking">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Mar 24, 2025</span>

        </h3><p>In the previous post, we gave an introduction and explained the basic concept of the Strategy Pattern. Now, we want to go a bit further and demonstrate how it works in practice alongside a dependency injection in .NET Core.

        </h3><p>Today, WinForms apps mainly belong to legacy code because of increasing popularity of WPF. And when one team decides about the development stack for the brand new desktop application, they mainly vote for WPF.

        </h3><p>The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime, providing flexibility in designing software. It’s particularly useful when you have multiple ways of performing a task, and you want to choose the implementation dynamically without altering the client code. <a title="Read more..." href="/design-patterns-strategy">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 10, 2025</span>

            Composition Over Inheritence
          </a>
        </h3><p>Inheritence is often misused or overused or even forced for several reasons, and they are mostly due to education, misunderstanding or habit. Many developers who studied OOP are introduced with inheritence in early stage and then it stays with them as a default way how to build relationships between objects. Escaping this matrix can be quite challenging, as lacking alternative perspectives often leads to the trap of believing that inheritance is the solution to everything. Here, we will try to find the reasoning behind this way of thinking. <a title="Read more..." href="/composition-over-inheritence">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 4, 2025</span>

It won’t happen again for sure.” You are thinking about this and in the meantime your team lead comes into the office and interrupts your thoughts with the similar story: ”Hey guys, only this time we need to do extra effort and after that we will be more concerned about deadlines.” Few months later, a new project and the same story.

        </h3><p>This is a very common subject that many of us have already experienced. But when you realize that half of what has been said at interviews is actually a lie, you are already at least six months in the company, you have already started some project and it wouldn’t be appropriate to leave the company at that moment. <a title="Read more..." href="/why-do-employers-lie-in-interviews">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Feb 3, 2025</span>

            Design Patterns: Factory Method
          </a>
        </h3><p>Let’s continue our series on design patterns with the Factory Method. Like the Builder or Singleton patterns we covered in previous posts, the Factory Method is also one of the creational patterns. It introduces a slightly more complex approach, offering a higher level of abstraction for object creation. Additionally, it helps decouple the object creation process from the rest of the application. <a title="Read more..." href="/design-patterns-factory-method">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 26, 2025</span>

            Keep Your Database In Sync With Application: Fluent Migrator
          </a>
        </h3><p>In this post, we continue to explore ways to free your application from being tightly bound to the Entity Framework environment. The primary goal is to offer an alternative solution that is not only more flexible and robust but also gives you, as a developer, greater control over database manipulation with less abstraction and complexity. Here, we introduce a library for database migrations, which serves as a natural extension to tools like Dapper and SqlKata. <a title="Read more..." href="/keep-your-database-in-sync-with-application-fluent-migrator">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 25, 2025</span>

            Dapper On Steroids: SqlKata
          </a>
        </h3><p>Dapper is a lightweight, high-performance ORM for .NET. It is widely used because of its simplicity and speed. Dapper in its essence provides simple mapping to POCO and works with raw queries minimizing the overhead. On the other hand it lacks of flexibility in terms of query writing, because we need to write queries like static strings. One simple example is shown in the code snippet below. <a title="Read more..." href="/dapper-on-steroids-sqlkata">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 22, 2025</span>

            Design Patterns: Builder
          </a>
        </h3><p>This is also, like a Singleton, one of the creational design patterns. It provides the way of creating complex objects step by step by simple chaining and every particular step is independent of other steps. <a title="Read more..." href="/design-patterns-builder">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 15, 2025</span>

          </a>
        </h3><p>A well-maintained Git log is more than just a record of commits—it’s a story of your project’s growth, collaboration, and problem-solving. But as projects scale and teams grow, Git logs can become cluttered, making it harder to trace changes, understand context, or troubleshoot issues. <a title="Read more..." href="/make-git-log-great-again-merge-vs-rebase">→</a></p></li><li><span class="post-meta">Jan 8, 2025</span>
